	info = {"Good afternoon, interested party and loyal soldier to the SOM. <br>
	<br>
	We have managed to modify a pair of unboxers to output more...Usable items for us.
	Simply use the red painted unboxers if such an outcome is convenient, then, continue with the procedure as normal.<br>
	<br>
	We will note that some items will not be converted, as our technicians are still tinkering with them. Don't worry, you'll still get their original variant, however.
	Below are some of the potential outcomes, recipes are below noted but otherwise the same as usual. Good luck on your missions.
